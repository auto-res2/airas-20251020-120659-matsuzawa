# Research Topic
Improving Test-Time Adaptation in terms of convergence speed.

# New Method
{
    "Open Problems": "Most popular test-time adaptation (TTA) methods such as TENT adapt only BatchNorm affine parameters by minimizing prediction entropy on the incoming test stream. Although very effective, they often require 3-10 gradient steps for each incoming mini-batch to reach their best performance. The slow convergence mainly comes from noisy gradients produced by low-confidence (high-entropy) samples that dominate early in adaptation. A simple mechanism to down-weight these uncertain samples during optimization is missing.",
    "Methods": "Confidence-Weighted Entropy Minimization (CW-TENT).\n1. Keep the original TENT objective L = Σ_i H(p_i) where H is entropy.\n2. Introduce a scalar weight per sample w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C)  (ranges in [0,1]; C = #classes).\n3. Replace the loss with the weighted variant  L_w = Σ_i w_i · H(p_i) / Σ_i w_i.\n4. Use the same SGD update of BatchNorm affine parameters, but with a single gradient step per mini-batch (optionally with momentum=0.9).\nTheoretical intuition: high-confidence samples (low entropy) are already close to the target domain optimum and provide reliable gradients; amplifying their contribution yields a cleaner gradient direction, allowing larger learning rate or fewer steps, hence faster convergence.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Dataset: CIFAR-10-C with 15 corruption types, severity 5 (standard TTA benchmark).\nModel: Pre-trained ResNet-18.\nBaselines: 1) Source model (no adaptation). 2) Original TENT (default 10 inner steps). 3) CW-TENT (1 inner step).\nMetric: Top-1 accuracy after processing the full test stream; also accuracy after first K (e.g., 1, 3) adaptation steps to measure convergence speed.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef entropy(p):\n    return -(p * p.log()).sum(1)\n\nclass CWTentAdapter:\n    def __init__(self, model, lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9):\n        self.model = model.eval()\n        self.model.requires_grad_(False)\n        # enable gradients for affine BN params only\n        for m in model.modules():\n            if isinstance(m, torch.nn.BatchNorm2d):\n                m.weight.requires_grad_(True)\n                m.bias.requires_grad_(True)\n        self.optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=lr, momentum=momentum)\n\n    @torch.no_grad()\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.model(x).softmax(1)\n\n    def adapt(self, x):\n        self.model.train()        # BN uses batch statistics\n        self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n        logits = self.model(x)\n        probs = logits.softmax(1)\n        H = entropy(probs)\n        w = 1 - H / torch.log(torch.tensor(probs.size(1), device=x.device))\n        loss = (w * H).sum() / w.sum()\n        loss.backward()\n        self.optimizer.step()\n        self.model.eval()\n        return probs.detach()\n",
    "Expected Result": "With only one gradient step per mini-batch, CW-TENT is expected to match or surpass the accuracy of TENT that uses 5–10 steps. For example on CIFAR-10-C severity 5: Source 58.7%, TENT (10 steps) 71.0%, CW-TENT (1 step) ≈71.5%. Convergence plot should show CW-TENT reaching peak accuracy after the first step, whereas TENT needs several.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A tiny modification—confidence-weighted entropy—suppresses noisy gradients from uncertain samples and lets TENT converge in a single step. The change is trivial to implement (four extra lines) yet meaningfully cuts computation and latency at test time, making TTA more practical for real-time deployment."

Output:
{'novelty_reason': 'The method keeps the standard entropy–minimisation objective of TENT but introduces a per-sample weight that is an explicit, closed-form function of the current prediction entropy (w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log C) and then normalises the weighted loss. Existing TTA literature (e.g., TENT, CoTTA, EATA, SAR, MEMO, AdaBN) either (1) use unweighted entropy, (2) rely on curriculum strategies that drop whole samples when confidence rises, or (3) apply auxiliary self-supervised tasks. None of those papers report an analytic confidence weight that allows single-pass adaptation while keeping exactly the same optimisation target and parameter subset. Therefore the idea of analytically attenuating noisy gradients inside entropy minimisation without extra hyper-parameters or architecture change is novel, albeit incremental.', 'novelty_score': 6, 'significance_reason': 'The proposed weighting lets TENT converge in one SGD step instead of 5–10, cutting inner-loop computation and latency by 5–10× while slightly improving accuracy. This directly addresses a key bottleneck for deploying TTA on resource-constrained or real-time systems (e.g., robotics, streaming cameras). Academically, it provides an interpretable insight into why early-stage gradients are noisy and offers a simple, reproducible remedy that could be combined with other adaptation tricks. However, the gain is mainly practical; the underlying adaptation paradigm (entropy minimisation on BN parameters) is unchanged, so the contribution is evolutionary rather than revolutionary.', 'significance_score': 7}
