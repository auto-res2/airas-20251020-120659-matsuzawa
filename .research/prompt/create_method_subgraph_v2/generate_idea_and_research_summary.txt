    "open_problems": "Most popular test-time adaptation (TTA) methods such as TENT adapt only BatchNorm affine parameters by minimizing prediction entropy on the incoming test stream. Although very effective, they often require 3-10 gradient steps for each incoming mini-batch to reach their best performance. The slow convergence mainly comes from noisy gradients produced by low-confidence (high-entropy) samples that dominate early in adaptation. A simple mechanism to down-weight these uncertain samples during optimization is missing.",
    "methods": "Confidence-Weighted Entropy Minimization (CW-TENT).\n1. Keep the original TENT objective L = Σ_i H(p_i) where H is entropy.\n2. Introduce a scalar weight per sample w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C)  (ranges in [0,1]; C = #classes).\n3. Replace the loss with the weighted variant  L_w = Σ_i w_i · H(p_i) / Σ_i w_i.\n4. Use the same SGD update of BatchNorm affine parameters, but with a single gradient step per mini-batch (optionally with momentum=0.9).\nTheoretical intuition: high-confidence samples (low entropy) are already close to the target domain optimum and provide reliable gradients; amplifying their contribution yields a cleaner gradient direction, allowing larger learning rate or fewer steps, hence faster convergence.",
    "experimental_setup": "Dataset: CIFAR-10-C with 15 corruption types, severity 5 (standard TTA benchmark).\nModel: Pre-trained ResNet-18.\nBaselines: 1) Source model (no adaptation). 2) Original TENT (default 10 inner steps). 3) CW-TENT (1 inner step).\nMetric: Top-1 accuracy after processing the full test stream; also accuracy after first K (e.g., 1, 3) adaptation steps to measure convergence speed.",

    "expected_result": "With only one gradient step per mini-batch, CW-TENT is expected to match or surpass the accuracy of TENT that uses 5–10 steps. For example on CIFAR-10-C severity 5: Source 58.7%, TENT (10 steps) 71.0%, CW-TENT (1 step) ≈71.5%. Convergence plot should show CW-TENT reaching peak accuracy after the first step, whereas TENT needs several.",
    "expected_conclusion": "A tiny modification—confidence-weighted entropy—suppresses noisy gradients from uncertain samples and lets TENT converge in a single step. The change is trivial to implement (four extra lines) yet meaningfully cuts computation and latency at test time, making TTA more practical for real-time deployment."
