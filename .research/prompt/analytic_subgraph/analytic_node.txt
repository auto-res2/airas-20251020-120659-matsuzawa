# Proposed Method
{
    "Open Problems": "Most popular test-time adaptation (TTA) methods such as TENT adapt only BatchNorm affine parameters by minimizing prediction entropy on the incoming test stream. Although very effective, they often require 3-10 gradient steps for each incoming mini-batch to reach their best performance. The slow convergence mainly comes from noisy gradients produced by low-confidence (high-entropy) samples that dominate early in adaptation. A simple mechanism to down-weight these uncertain samples during optimization is missing.",
    "Methods": "Confidence-Weighted Entropy Minimization (CW-TENT).\n1. Keep the original TENT objective L = Σ_i H(p_i) where H is entropy.\n2. Introduce a scalar weight per sample w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C)  (ranges in [0,1]; C = #classes).\n3. Replace the loss with the weighted variant  L_w = Σ_i w_i · H(p_i) / Σ_i w_i.\n4. Use the same SGD update of BatchNorm affine parameters, but with a single gradient step per mini-batch (optionally with momentum=0.9).\nTheoretical intuition: high-confidence samples (low entropy) are already close to the target domain optimum and provide reliable gradients; amplifying their contribution yields a cleaner gradient direction, allowing larger learning rate or fewer steps, hence faster convergence.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Dataset: CIFAR-10-C with 15 corruption types, severity 5 (standard TTA benchmark).\nModel: Pre-trained ResNet-18.\nBaselines: 1) Source model (no adaptation). 2) Original TENT (default 10 inner steps). 3) CW-TENT (1 inner step).\nMetric: Top-1 accuracy after processing the full test stream; also accuracy after first K (e.g., 1, 3) adaptation steps to measure convergence speed.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef entropy(p):\n    return -(p * p.log()).sum(1)\n\nclass CWTentAdapter:\n    def __init__(self, model, lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9):\n        self.model = model.eval()\n        self.model.requires_grad_(False)\n        # enable gradients for affine BN params only\n        for m in model.modules():\n            if isinstance(m, torch.nn.BatchNorm2d):\n                m.weight.requires_grad_(True)\n                m.bias.requires_grad_(True)\n        self.optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=lr, momentum=momentum)\n\n    @torch.no_grad()\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.model(x).softmax(1)\n\n    def adapt(self, x):\n        self.model.train()        # BN uses batch statistics\n        self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n        logits = self.model(x)\n        probs = logits.softmax(1)\n        H = entropy(probs)\n        w = 1 - H / torch.log(torch.tensor(probs.size(1), device=x.device))\n        loss = (w * H).sum() / w.sum()\n        loss.backward()\n        self.optimizer.step()\n        self.model.eval()\n        return probs.detach()\n",
    "Expected Result": "With only one gradient step per mini-batch, CW-TENT is expected to match or surpass the accuracy of TENT that uses 5–10 steps. For example on CIFAR-10-C severity 5: Source 58.7%, TENT (10 steps) 71.0%, CW-TENT (1 step) ≈71.5%. Convergence plot should show CW-TENT reaching peak accuracy after the first step, whereas TENT needs several.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A tiny modification—confidence-weighted entropy—suppresses noisy gradients from uncertain samples and lets TENT converge in a single step. The change is trivial to implement (four extra lines) yet meaningfully cuts computation and latency at test time, making TTA more practical for real-time deployment."

# Experimental Design

## Experiment Summary
This experiment evaluates the ability of Confidence-Weighted TENT (CW-TENT) to accelerate and improve test-time adaptation (TTA) of image classifiers under distribution shift. A pre-trained ResNet-18 is exposed to a streaming evaluation set composed of CIFAR-10-C (corruption severity 5). At every incoming mini-batch the model adapts only the affine parameters of its Batch-Norm layers. CW-TENT assigns each sample a confidence weight w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C) and minimizes the weighted entropy L_w = Σ w_i·H(p_i) / Σ w_i with a single SGD update per batch. Performance is tracked online and compared against: (1) the static source model (no adaptation) and (2) vanilla TENT that performs 10 inner gradient steps of un-weighted entropy minimization. The main workflow is: 1) load the source checkpoint, 2) build three adapters (None, TENT, CW-TENT), 3) iterate over the corruption stream, calling adapter.adapt(x) then measuring accuracy, 4) aggregate final and early-step accuracies, 5) perform a small hyper-parameter grid search over learning-rate, momentum and weight-temperature for CW-TENT. All code runs on a single A100 GPU but can be parallelised across the 8 available devices for faster hyper-parameter sweeps. The primary goal is to demonstrate that CW-TENT reaches or surpasses the accuracy of TENT while using only one gradient step, reducing latency and computation.

## Proposed Method Details
Confidence-Weighted TENT (CW-TENT) augments the original Test-time Entropy Minimisation (TENT) framework with per-sample confidence weights to dampen the influence of uncertain (high-entropy) predictions during adaptation.

Objective: For a mini-batch of predictions p_i over C classes, compute entropy H(p_i) = −Σ_c p_{ic} log p_{ic}. Define weight w_i = 1 − H(p_i)/log(C) ∈ [0,1]. Optimise the weighted entropy
    L_w = Σ_i w_i · H(p_i) / Σ_i w_i.

Optimisation protocol:
1. Freeze all network parameters except γ, β of BatchNorm layers; keep them in training mode so that batch statistics are updated.
2. For each incoming batch x:
   a. Forward pass → logits → softmax p.
   b. Compute H(p), w, and L_w.
   c. One SGD step on BN affine params (lr≈1e-3, momentum optional).
   d. Switch model back to eval mode for inference until next batch arrives.

Theoretical intuition: samples with low entropy have gradients that more accurately point toward the target-domain optimum. Re-weighting removes noise caused by high-entropy instances, allowing the optimiser to converge in a single step.

Implementation: apart from four extra lines to compute w and L_w, the code is identical to TENT. No additional memory or forward passes are required, preserving TENT’s simplicity while cutting adaptation steps 10×.

    "analysis_report": "1. Overview of the study\nThe goal of the study was to verify whether Confidence-Weighted TENT (CW-TENT) can accelerate and improve test-time adaptation of a ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10-C (severity 5) when compared with a representative baseline (denoted “comparative-1”, i.e. the original, un-weighted TENT with its default hyper-parameters). Two independent runs were carried out:\n• proposed-ResNet-18-… – CW-TENT, one inner gradient step per batch.\n• comparative-1-ResNet-18-… – baseline TENT.\nPerformance was measured as top-1 accuracy accumulated over the complete corruption stream.\n\n2. Key quantitative results\n• CW-TENT final accuracy: 10.11 % (≈0.1011).\n• Baseline TENT final accuracy: 39.44 % (≈0.3944).\nThe 29.3-percentage-point gap in favour of the baseline is substantial. According to the paired significance file (significance_tests.json, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank), the p-value is <0.01, confirming that the performance difference is statistically significant.\n\n3. Behaviour across the test stream\nLearning-curve inspection (learning_curve.pdf):\n• CW-TENT starts around 9–10 % accuracy (chance level for CIFAR-10) and remains flat throughout the entire stream; no measurable adaptation is observed.\n• Baseline TENT begins at ≈34 % after the first batch and increases gradually to ≈39 % by the end of the evaluation.\n• The batch-wise accuracy distribution plot (batch_acc_distribution.pdf) shows CW-TENT tightly concentrated near chance, whereas TENT exhibits a broad distribution with a long tail toward higher accuracies, indicating successful per-batch corrections.\n\n4. Error analysis\nThe confusion matrix for CW-TENT reveals that the model is heavily biased toward 1–2 classes and fails to revise this bias during adaptation, suggesting that the confidence weights either:\n(a) saturate at very low values, preventing any meaningful gradient signal, or\n(b) are computed from highly entropic predictions whose weights collapse to ≈0, effectively nullifying the optimisation objective.\n\n5. Interpretation and possible causes of failure\nThe empirical evidence contradicts the theoretical expectation that confidence weighting should accelerate convergence:\n• One gradient step may be insufficient if the weights down-scale most samples early in adaptation, leaving almost no learning signal.\n• The scalar weight definition w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C) assumes well-calibrated probabilities; corruption-induced mis-calibration could push H(p_i) close to log(C) for nearly all samples, shrinking w_i toward 0 and freezing learning.\n• Learning-rate, momentum or weight normalisation could require further tuning when confidence weighting is applied.\n\n6. Overall conclusion\nUnder the present hyper-parameter settings and implementation, the proposed CW-TENT method does not demonstrate an advantage over the baseline; in fact, it performs markedly worse (10.1 % vs. 39.4 % final accuracy). The result is statistically significant and is consistent across the entire test stream. Further investigation—e.g. weight rescaling, additional inner steps, or temperature-controlled confidence estimates—is necessary before the approach can be considered viable for test-time adaptation on CIFAR-10-C.\n\n7. Recommendations for future work\n1) Verify the correctness of the weight calculation and its range on corrupted samples.\n2) Conduct a grid search over learning-rate and momentum specifically for CW-TENT.\n3) Evaluate variants that clip or re-normalise the weights to preserve gradient magnitude.\n4) Test CW-TENT with 3–5 inner steps to decouple the effect of weighting from the effect of step budget.\n5) Inspect running batch-norm statistics to ensure they are updated as intended.\nOnly after addressing these points can the potential computational benefits of confidence-weighted entropy minimisation be fairly re-assessed."
