# Proposed Method
{
    "Open Problems": "Most popular test-time adaptation (TTA) methods such as TENT adapt only BatchNorm affine parameters by minimizing prediction entropy on the incoming test stream. Although very effective, they often require 3-10 gradient steps for each incoming mini-batch to reach their best performance. The slow convergence mainly comes from noisy gradients produced by low-confidence (high-entropy) samples that dominate early in adaptation. A simple mechanism to down-weight these uncertain samples during optimization is missing.",
    "Methods": "Confidence-Weighted Entropy Minimization (CW-TENT).\n1. Keep the original TENT objective L = Σ_i H(p_i) where H is entropy.\n2. Introduce a scalar weight per sample w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C)  (ranges in [0,1]; C = #classes).\n3. Replace the loss with the weighted variant  L_w = Σ_i w_i · H(p_i) / Σ_i w_i.\n4. Use the same SGD update of BatchNorm affine parameters, but with a single gradient step per mini-batch (optionally with momentum=0.9).\nTheoretical intuition: high-confidence samples (low entropy) are already close to the target domain optimum and provide reliable gradients; amplifying their contribution yields a cleaner gradient direction, allowing larger learning rate or fewer steps, hence faster convergence.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Dataset: CIFAR-10-C with 15 corruption types, severity 5 (standard TTA benchmark).\nModel: Pre-trained ResNet-18.\nBaselines: 1) Source model (no adaptation). 2) Original TENT (default 10 inner steps). 3) CW-TENT (1 inner step).\nMetric: Top-1 accuracy after processing the full test stream; also accuracy after first K (e.g., 1, 3) adaptation steps to measure convergence speed.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef entropy(p):\n    return -(p * p.log()).sum(1)\n\nclass CWTentAdapter:\n    def __init__(self, model, lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9):\n        self.model = model.eval()\n        self.model.requires_grad_(False)\n        # enable gradients for affine BN params only\n        for m in model.modules():\n            if isinstance(m, torch.nn.BatchNorm2d):\n                m.weight.requires_grad_(True)\n                m.bias.requires_grad_(True)\n        self.optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=lr, momentum=momentum)\n\n    @torch.no_grad()\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.model(x).softmax(1)\n\n    def adapt(self, x):\n        self.model.train()        # BN uses batch statistics\n        self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n        logits = self.model(x)\n        probs = logits.softmax(1)\n        H = entropy(probs)\n        w = 1 - H / torch.log(torch.tensor(probs.size(1), device=x.device))\n        loss = (w * H).sum() / w.sum()\n        loss.backward()\n        self.optimizer.step()\n        self.model.eval()\n        return probs.detach()\n",
    "Expected Result": "With only one gradient step per mini-batch, CW-TENT is expected to match or surpass the accuracy of TENT that uses 5–10 steps. For example on CIFAR-10-C severity 5: Source 58.7%, TENT (10 steps) 71.0%, CW-TENT (1 step) ≈71.5%. Convergence plot should show CW-TENT reaching peak accuracy after the first step, whereas TENT needs several.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A tiny modification—confidence-weighted entropy—suppresses noisy gradients from uncertain samples and lets TENT converge in a single step. The change is trivial to implement (four extra lines) yet meaningfully cuts computation and latency at test time, making TTA more practical for real-time deployment."

# Experimental Design

## Experiment Summary
This experiment evaluates the ability of Confidence-Weighted TENT (CW-TENT) to accelerate and improve test-time adaptation (TTA) of image classifiers under distribution shift. A pre-trained ResNet-18 is exposed to a streaming evaluation set composed of CIFAR-10-C (corruption severity 5). At every incoming mini-batch the model adapts only the affine parameters of its Batch-Norm layers. CW-TENT assigns each sample a confidence weight w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log(C) and minimizes the weighted entropy L_w = Σ w_i·H(p_i) / Σ w_i with a single SGD update per batch. Performance is tracked online and compared against: (1) the static source model (no adaptation) and (2) vanilla TENT that performs 10 inner gradient steps of un-weighted entropy minimization. The main workflow is: 1) load the source checkpoint, 2) build three adapters (None, TENT, CW-TENT), 3) iterate over the corruption stream, calling adapter.adapt(x) then measuring accuracy, 4) aggregate final and early-step accuracies, 5) perform a small hyper-parameter grid search over learning-rate, momentum and weight-temperature for CW-TENT. All code runs on a single A100 GPU but can be parallelised across the 8 available devices for faster hyper-parameter sweeps. The primary goal is to demonstrate that CW-TENT reaches or surpasses the accuracy of TENT while using only one gradient step, reducing latency and computation.

## Proposed Method Details
Confidence-Weighted TENT (CW-TENT) augments the original Test-time Entropy Minimisation (TENT) framework with per-sample confidence weights to dampen the influence of uncertain (high-entropy) predictions during adaptation.

Objective: For a mini-batch of predictions p_i over C classes, compute entropy H(p_i) = −Σ_c p_{ic} log p_{ic}. Define weight w_i = 1 − H(p_i)/log(C) ∈ [0,1]. Optimise the weighted entropy
    L_w = Σ_i w_i · H(p_i) / Σ_i w_i.

Optimisation protocol:
1. Freeze all network parameters except γ, β of BatchNorm layers; keep them in training mode so that batch statistics are updated.
2. For each incoming batch x:
   a. Forward pass → logits → softmax p.
   b. Compute H(p), w, and L_w.
   c. One SGD step on BN affine params (lr≈1e-3, momentum optional).
   d. Switch model back to eval mode for inference until next batch arrives.

Theoretical intuition: samples with low entropy have gradients that more accurately point toward the target-domain optimum. Re-weighting removes noise caused by high-entropy instances, allowing the optimiser to converge in a single step.

Implementation: apart from four extra lines to compute w and L_w, the code is identical to TENT. No additional memory or forward passes are required, preserving TENT’s simplicity while cutting adaptation steps 10×.

    "analysis_report": "Comprehensive Analysis of CW-TENT versus Baselines on CIFAR-10-C (severity 5)\n\n1. Experimental Recap\n   • Task: online test-time adaptation (TTA) for a pre-trained ResNet-18 evaluated on CIFAR-10-C corruption-severity 5.\n   • Methods compared\n        – Source (static – implicitly represented by “comparative-1” run).\n        – TENT (unweighted entropy minimisation, 10 inner steps – also folded into “comparative-1” because only one baseline run is present).\n        – CW-TENT (proposed confidence-weighted variant, 1 inner step – run id “proposed”).\n   • Metric: final top-1 accuracy after the full corruption stream; lower-bound random-guess is 10 % (10-class problem).\n\n2. Key Results\n   ┌──────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐\n   │ Method / run id         │ Final accuracy │\n   ├──────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤\n   │ CW-TENT (proposed)       │ 10.1 %         │\n   │ Baseline (“comparative-1”)│ 40.8 %         │\n   └──────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘\n\n   • CW-TENT reaches only 10.1 % accuracy – essentially random chance – whereas the baseline achieves 40.8 %.\n   • The accompanying learning-curve (learning_curve.pdf) shows CW-TENT’s accuracy collapsing within the first few mini-batches and never recovering, while the baseline rises steadily to ~41 %.\n   • The batch-accuracy distribution plot confirms this: CW-TENT’s per-batch performance clusters tightly around 10 %, indicating complete failure to learn, whereas the baseline exhibits a long tail up to >60 % on clean batches.\n\n3. Statistical Significance\n   • A paired two-tailed t-test over per-batch accuracies (significance_tests.json) gives p < 10⁻⁶, firmly rejecting the null hypothesis that CW-TENT and the baseline perform equally.\n   • 95 % confidence interval of the accuracy gap: [29.1 %, 34.0 %] in favour of the baseline.\n\n4. Diagnostic Discussion\n   a. Weighting strategy side-effect       \n      – By construction, w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log C ∈ [0,1]. On highly corrupted inputs the initial predictions are near-uniform, so H(p_i) ≈ log C ⇒ w_i ≈ 0. Consequently almost every sample in early batches receives a vanishing weight, driving the normaliser Σw_i → 0 and exploding the effective learning rate. This explains the immediate divergence seen in the loss curve.\n   b. One-step optimisation instability\n      – With essentially no reliable gradient signal (all weights ≈0) the single-step update pushes BN affine parameters arbitrarily, after which performance flat-lines at chance level.\n   c. Implementation check\n      – The learning curves reveal that entropy itself never decreases, corroborating the hypothesis of ill-conditioned updates rather than a coding bug in the forward pass.\n\n5. Implications\n   • The present empirical evidence clearly shows that CW-TENT, as currently instantiated, does not outperform the baseline; in fact it catastrophically under-performs, eliminating any practical utility.\n   • The results falsify the original hypothesis that confidence weighting would accelerate convergence and improve final accuracy.\n\n6. Recommendations for Salvaging the Idea\n   • Temperature-smoothing of w_i: replace w_i = max(ε, 1 – H(p_i)/log C) with ε≈0.2 to prevent zero-gradient collapse.\n   • Warm-up schedule: run standard TENT for the first N batches (e.g. N = 5) to raise confidence before enabling weighting.\n   • Multiple (but still fewer) inner steps: try 3 steps instead of 1 to stabilise updates without incurring the full cost of 10-step TENT.\n   • Gradient-clipping on BN parameters to avoid explosions when Σw_i is small.\n\n7. Conclusion\n   Contrary to expectations, the proposed Confidence-Weighted TENT fails to deliver any measurable benefit and in fact reduces performance to random guessing on CIFAR-10-C severity 5, while the vanilla baseline retains 40.8 % top-1 accuracy. Further algorithmic safeguards are required before confidence-weighting can be considered a viable improvement for test-time adaptation.\n"
