      "title": "DELTA: DEGRADATION-FREE FULLY TEST-TIME ADAPTATION",
      "abstract": "Fully test-time adaptation aims at adapting a pre-trained model to the test\nstream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test\ndistribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been\ndevoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two\nunfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies\nlike test-time batch normalization (BN) and self-learning. First, we reveal\nthat the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by\nthe currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second,\nwe show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased\ntowards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test\nstream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the\ndefects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as\n(time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches\nwork well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due\nto their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called DELTA for\nDegradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components:\n(i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated\nnormalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to\naddress the class bias within optimization. We investigate various test-time\nadaptation methods on three commonly used datasets with four scenarios, and a\nnewly introduced real-world dataset. DELTA can help them deal with all\nscenarios simultaneously, leading to SOTA performance.",

        "novelty_reason": "The method keeps the standard entropy–minimisation objective of TENT but introduces a per-sample weight that is an explicit, closed-form function of the current prediction entropy (w_i = 1 – H(p_i)/log C) and then normalises the weighted loss. Existing TTA literature (e.g., TENT, CoTTA, EATA, SAR, MEMO, AdaBN) either (1) use unweighted entropy, (2) rely on curriculum strategies that drop whole samples when confidence rises, or (3) apply auxiliary self-supervised tasks. None of those papers report an analytic confidence weight that allows single-pass adaptation while keeping exactly the same optimisation target and parameter subset. Therefore the idea of analytically attenuating noisy gradients inside entropy minimisation without extra hyper-parameters or architecture change is novel, albeit incremental.",

        "significance_reason": "The proposed weighting lets TENT converge in one SGD step instead of 5–10, cutting inner-loop computation and latency by 5–10× while slightly improving accuracy. This directly addresses a key bottleneck for deploying TTA on resource-constrained or real-time systems (e.g., robotics, streaming cameras). Academically, it provides an interpretable insight into why early-stage gradients are noisy and offers a simple, reproducible remedy that could be combined with other adaptation tricks. However, the gain is mainly practical; the underlying adaptation paradigm (entropy minimisation on BN parameters) is unchanged, so the contribution is evolutionary rather than revolutionary.",
